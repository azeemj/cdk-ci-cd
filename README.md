# cdk-ci-cd
This is intended to build CI/CD pipeline in CDK

Scenario:
Model and implement a web service platform using serverless technologies on a prominent IaaS provider.
1.	You need to implement a CI/CD pipeline to deploy services to this platform. This CI/CD pipeline should be able to deploy the solution to multiple environments such as Development, Staging and Production. 
2.	You need to expose these services using an API layer and secure each and every service using a security token mechanism. Your solution should be able to deploy using a cloud deploy automation tool such as  AWS CDK or using any suitable IaC tool.
